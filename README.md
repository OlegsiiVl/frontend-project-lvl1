## What is this project?

This project is a set of 5 console math games designed to help break the monotony. Each game has a unique approach and is based on mathematical principles that must be applied to complete it.

1. "Even or Odd Check" - You are shown a random number and you need to answer "yes" if it's even or "no" if it's odd.
2. "Calculator" - You are shown a random math expression, such as 35 + 16, which you need to calculate and write the correct answer.
3. "Greatest Common Divisor" - You are shown two random numbers, such as 25 and 50. You need to calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.
4. "Arithmetic Progression" - You are shown a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, where a random number is replaced by two dots. You need to determine this number.
5. "Prime Number Check" - You are shown a random number and you need to answer "yes" if it's prime or "no" if it's not.

Each game has a unique set of rules. This project is designed to stimulate interest in mathematics and facilitate the learning process, or just to distract oneself.

## Minimum system requirements
Node.js 13.2.0 and higher.
## Installation instructions for the games
1. Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed. If your version of Node.js is below 13.2.0, you will need to update it. If you do not have Node.js installed, you will need to install it. You can check the version using the following command in the console/terminal:
```
node -v
```
1.1. Installation for Windows. Click => [скачать Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.15.0/node-v18.15.0-x86.msi) зrun the file, and follow the instructions.
1.2. Installation for MacOS. Click => [скачать Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/v19.8.1/node-v19.8.1.pkg) run the file, and follow the instructions.

2. Clone this repository to your workstation (PC):
```
