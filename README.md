## What is this project?

This project is a set of 5 console math games designed to help break the monotony. Each game has a unique approach and is based on mathematical principles that must be applied to complete it.

1. "Even or Odd Check" - You are shown a random number and you need to answer "yes" if it's even or "no" if it's odd.
2. "Calculator" - You are shown a random math expression, such as 35 + 16, which you need to calculate and write the correct answer.
3. "Greatest Common Divisor" - You are shown two random numbers, such as 25 and 50. You need to calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.
4. "Arithmetic Progression" - You are shown a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, where a random number is replaced by two dots. You need to determine this number.
5. "Prime Number Check" - You are shown a random number and you need to answer "yes" if it's prime or "no" if it's not.

Each game has a unique set of rules. This project is designed to stimulate interest in mathematics and facilitate the learning process, or just to distract oneself.

### Minimum system requirements
1. Node.js 13.2.0 and higher.
2. Git
### Installation instructions for the games
1. To install Git for Windows => [download Git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.40.0.windows.1/Git-2.40.0-64-bit.exe) run the file, and follow the instructions.
